% In this section, the proposed framework of the simulation backend is described.

The simulation backend is currently built up in LTSpice with the hierarchy in \autoref{framework:fig:simulation_backend_ca1}. The \ac{CBA} can be auto-generated using the Python generation stack by passing in parameters like the number wordlines/bitlines and resistance states. After the necessary files are generated, the simulation stack exposes \acp{API}. The simulation \acp{API} is designed to be easily swapped with the actual hardware \acp{API} and runs interoperably with the algorithms at higher levels.
